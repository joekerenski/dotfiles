# System Setup from Scratch

Just run this script, dont look into the bash files, never worry about security
ever, we are all acting on vibes here. Script works for macOS and arch:

```console
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joekerenski/dotfiles-public/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

And we are done!

## Why?

I like to periodically nuke my system and rebuild from scratch. Chezmoi and
Gopass seem to be the perfect choices to recover my complete dev environment
from scratch without much hassle both on macOS and arch.
